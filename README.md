This is a novel reader app powered by react-native 0.52.2.

it have shelf, fattenList, read page, record and so on.

Tip: it just support chinese novel.

example pic: wait to be added.

it use:
* dva-core (a light dvaJs framework)
* react-navigation
* react-native-elements
* react-native-side-menu
* react-native-splash-screen
* view-pager (self Maintain)
* react-native-largeList (a good big data show list)

it still be consummated, but compare with my previous projects, I think it can be tried~

I hope it can help you to complete something what you want~ :)
