## 1. introduction

This is a novel reader app powered by react-native `0.60.5` .

it have shelf, fattenList, read page, record and so on.

Tip: it just support chinese novel, if you interested about another language, you can try to change it by yourself.

it use:

* dva-core (a light dvaJs framework)
* react-navigation

* react-native-side-menu
* react-native-splash-screen
* view-pager (self Maintain)
